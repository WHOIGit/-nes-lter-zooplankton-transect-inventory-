This data package includes data from MIT-WHOI Joint Program (JP) cruises funded by WHOI Academic Programs Office, with Chief Scientists Glen Gawarkiewicz (AR38) and Joel Llopiz (AR32 and AR63). For other cruises on R/V Neil Armstrong, we thank the Ocean Observatories Initiative, funded by the National Science Foundation under Cooperative Agreement No. 1743430.
We’d like to thank additional personnel who conducted bongo tow sampling on Transect cruises, including Sarah G. Glancy, Isabel Honda, Stace Beaulieu, Taylor Crockford, Emily Peacock, Diana Fontaine, Julia Cox, Thomas Heine, Pierre Marrec, Adrienne Breef-Pilz, John San Soucie, Helena McMonagle, Justin Suca, and many others that have assisted with NES-LTER sampling. Sampling wouldn’t have been possible without the hard work of the ship technicians, marine techs, engineers, winch operators, and the entire ship crew. Thank you all for your efforts!
