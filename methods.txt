# Field operations for net tows

Here, we summarize the field operations for net tows, since the focus of this data package is on the sample preparation in the lab on board ship. Field operations for net tows are logged in the event log data package [knb-lter-nes.20] for Transect cruises, and results from sample analyses will be detailed in separate data packages, e.g., zooplankton abundance.

1. Field operations for oblique tow bongo/ring net
During dedicated transect cruises (i.e. winter and summer, aboard the Endeavor), zooplankton is sampled at each regular transect station (LTER1 – LTER11). Zooplankton is collected with 61-cm diameter bongo nets, one of which has 335-µm mesh and the other 150-µm mesh (each is 3.2 m long, as they have similar porosity values—45% and 46%). A General Oceanics mechanical flowmeter is attached in the center of each mouth. In addition to the bongo nets, a 30-cm-diameter, 20-µm-mesh ring net is attached ~2 m above the bongo frame with a book clamp. This net is non-quantitative and is only used for size fraction stable isotope analysis—specifically the 20-100 µm and 100-200 µm fractions.
Tows are single oblique (down then up only once) towing at a speed through the water of 1.5 to 2.0 knots. Target net depth is 5 m off the bottom or 200 m (when bottom depth exceeds 200 m).

2. Field operations for vertical tow ring net 
During transect cruises with collaborators (i.e., OOI in spring and fall), zooplankton is sampled at each regular transect station (LTER1 – LTER11). Zooplankton is collected with a 30cm ring net with 150-µm mesh (2 m long with a porosity of 46%). The tow is a single vertical tow after sending the weight to 1 m off the bottom (the mouth of the net will be 3 m off of the bottom) as determined by a CTD or onboard bottom sounder, while Armstrong uses dynamic positioning systems to remain stationary. Winch pay out and retrieval speed will be 30 m/min. 

# Sampling protocols

1. Sampling protocol for oblique tow bongo/ring net
Upon retrieval, nets are rinsed with a seawater hose to collect all plankton in the cod ends. Cod ends are carefully removed (and not until the water level is below the cod end opening) while sitting within a bucket. Labeled cod ends are then brought inside within their similarly labeled buckets (distinguishing between the 335-µm and 150-µm mesh nets) for processing in the wet lab. Samples are split with a Folsom splitter according to an established plan for where the aliquots are going for the various planned analyses—specifically, preserved in a 5% buffered formalin-seawater solution or 95% ethanol, or frozen. 
These splits and their method of preservation are: 
- 335 µm mesh net:
- - ¾ split into 5% buffered formalin-seawater solution (for morphological IDs—to NOAA)
- - ¼ split in 95% ethanol (available for DNA metabarcoding—to Rynearson lab)
- 150 µm mesh net:
- - ¼ split into 95% ethanol (for morphological IDs—to Llopiz lab)
- - ¼ split into 95% ethanol (for DNA metabarcoding—to Rynearson lab)
- - ¼ split to be size fractionated on board (>1000 µm, 500-1000 µm, and 200-500 µm) for stable isotope analyses. Size fractions are frozen (-20°C) in vials.
- - ¼ split for fresh sorting on board and freezing of individual taxa (or the split will be frozen for later sorting of taxa in the lab) for stable isotope analyses—4 dominant taxa of copepods (e.g. Calanus, Centropages, Pseudocalanus, Oithona), as well as appendicularians and chaetognaths.

Detailed checklist of tasks and steps:
Upon retrieval
- Record flowmeter readings for each net
- Rinse nets from the outside of the net only, starting high and rinse all the way down to the cod end
- If there are a few large organisms in the sample (e.g. jellies), remove them prior to splitting and preserve them separately in ethanol. Use the large (~5 mm) sieve if needed. Note on the event log which net they were removed from, and label their jar appropriately.
- Rinse all sieves and anything with sample on it between all samples
- Rinse all gear with freshwater when sampling has ended for the cruise
- For 335 µm sample:
- - Split sample with Folsom splitter. 
- - Put 3/4 of the net into a glass quart jar with formalin to a 12% formalin/seawater mix, buffer with 1:1 disodium phosphate:monosodium phosphate.
- - Drain and gather the remaining ¼ split onto a ≤335-µm-mesh sieve and preserve in 95% ethanol using a glass pint jar. Jar should be at least 2/3’s full of ethanol  and 1/3 or less of plankton.
- - Make sure each sample has the correct internal and external label on it.
- - Store samples separately.
- For the 150 µm sample:
- - Split sample with Folsom splitter..
- - Preserve two ¼ splits in 95% ethanol by draining and gathering each on a 150 µm mesh sieve and transferring to a plastic pint jar using a squirt bottle of ethanol (one sample goes to Llopiz lab, one to Rynearson lab)
- - One of the remaining ¼ splits gets size fractionated on 1000 µm, 500 µm, and 200 µm sieves, and what is collected on each sieve gets drained and transferred to a cryovial and then frozen at -20°C
- - The other ¼ split will be drained and frozen at maximum -20 celcius
- - Make sure each sample has the correct internal and external label on it.
- - Place ethanol-preserved splits in their appropriate boxes (Llopiz and Rynearson labs)
- For the 20 µm net sample:
- - This sample is non-quantitative. target a well mixed sub-sample. 
- - Size fractions 100-200 µm and 20-100-µm are retained, drained and transferred to a cryovial and then frozen at -20°C
24 hrs after sampling
- Drain and replace ethanol of ethanol-preserved samples and note the date changed on the external jar labels and on the bongo event log sheet. 
- Test pH of formalin sample sand add additional buffer if pH is <7
Post-cruise
- Ensure that samples get to respective labs and advise on which, if any, samples need additional ethanol changes.

2. Sampling protocol for vertical tow ring net
Only seawater is used to collect the sample on the sieve to ready for preservation. The entire sample will go into a single jar with 95% ethanol (see notes below on removing gelatinous organisms). Ethanol will be changed 24hrs after initial preservation. 

Detailed checklist of tasks and steps:
Upon retrieval
- Drain the contents into a 150-µm sieve, and use pre-filtered seawater to rinse the cod end. Make sure the mesh on the cod end is rinsed well. 
- If there are a few large organisms in the sample (e.g. gelatinous or fish), remove them and preserve them separately in ethanol. Use the large (~5 mm) sieve if needed. 
- Transfer entire sample to a plastic 160z or 4oz jar depending on sample density.
- Make sure each sample has the correct internal and external label.
- Rinse all sieves and anything with sample on it with freshwater between all stations.
- Rinse all gear with freshwater when sampling has ended for the cruise.
24 hrs after sampling
- Drain and replace ethanol of ethanol-preserved samples and note the date changed on the external jar labels and on the bongo event log sheet.
- Note the date changed on the external jar labels and on the ring net event log sheet.

# Quality assurance and data package assembly

The inventory of physical samples from zooplankton net tows is compiled in a spreadsheet with validation for manual data entry. Data package assembly with metadata templates was completed in R, with documentation available at https://github.com/WHOIGit/nes-lter-zooplankton-transect-inventory.
